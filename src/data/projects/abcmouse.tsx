${_}
We redesigned the app internals to load and unload resources on demand using an in-house API and caching mechanism, while also addressing other memory leaks from static variables and lingering closures. In conjunction with the refactoring of performance-intensive C# reflection operations to use more performant alternatives, these changes reduced app startup times by 50%, eliminated app crashes on low-end devices, and expanded learning access to tens of thousands of children worldwide.`,

The management team was impressed by my initiative in assisting a QA automation teammate to streamline our testing process. I developed a recording tool to capture the names of interactive elements, which are essential for writing reliable, programmatic system tests for the ABCmouse mobile app. One colleague estimated it saved him a day's worth of work for every test he needed to write.`,
